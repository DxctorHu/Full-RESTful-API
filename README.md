# Full-RESTful-API
This RESTful API project utilizes Spring Boot with complete HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It uses JDBC and JPA for efficient MySQL database interactions. Security is enhanced via stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, and role-based access control is implemented to protect endpoints and resources.
