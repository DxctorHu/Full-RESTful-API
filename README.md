# SpringBoot RESTful API with JWT Authentication and MySQL Connectivity

# Overview
This project is a backend architecture developed using Spring Boot, designed to provide a robust and secure RESTful API. It leverages JDBC and Java Persistence API (JPA) for efficient database interactions and integrates MySQL for persistent data storage. The application includes comprehensive security measures with stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. The purpose of this project is to create an employee database.

# Features
- RESTful API: Fully implemented HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for seamless interaction with client applications.
- Spring Boot: Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for easy setup and development.
- JDBC and JPA: Combines JDBC for raw SQL operations and JPA for object-relational mapping.
- JWT Authentication: Implements stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens, ensuring secure and scalable access.
- Authorization: Role-based access control to secure endpoints and resources.
- MySQL Connectivity: Connects to a MySQL database for reliable and efficient data storage.
